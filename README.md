# description
this repository contains five main directories , each for AVL tree ,binary search tree, MST(Minimum spanning tree) using prims algorithm , simple graph creation and dijkstras shortest path algorithm . These directories contains three sub directories named src, include, makefile. src folder contains all the source code files. makefile directory contains makefile which is used generate final executable from all the .c files available in src directory . include directory contains header files that are to be included in the source files directory while compiling time with makefile.
# execution sequence
download the directoy and place all the source code , header files and makefile  at one place or directory. Now run the makefile by using the command make. you can observe final executable with name avl for avl related files and bst for binary search tree related files similarly prims and dijkstras. Now run this final executable generated.
